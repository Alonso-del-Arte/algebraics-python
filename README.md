# Algebraics, Python

WORK IN PROGRESS. This is for algebraic number theory, such as imaginary 
quadratic rings, pure cubic numbers and so on and so forth.

I might be duplicating effort that has already been made for Python. But if 
nothing else, this will help me understand object-oriented programming in 
Python.

As I figure out what is idiomatic in Python, I will do a lot of things the way I
do them in Java, which might not always be proper Python.
